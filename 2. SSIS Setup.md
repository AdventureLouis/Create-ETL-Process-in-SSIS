Now I will create a new project in SSIS.

open the Microsoft Visual Studio, the version of Microsoft Visual Studio I am using is 2019

![SSIS_Setup](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/1026fd22-bf2e-4c5e-b54e-8a22298fad0d)
After opening the Microsoft vs code, click on “Create a new project”
![SSIS_Setup2](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/5848d399-562e-4258-b4cc-b1290be73237)
In the search bar, type integration services project and select integration services, this is the same as SSIS, SSIS stands for SQL Server Integration Services.
![SSIS_Setup3](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/ff9da683-a9ca-44f2-a196-e8a4177ed358)
Next give a name to the project, in this publication, the name of the project is ETLT(Extract->Transform->Load->Transform) and you can choose the location where you want it saved and click Create at the bottom left

![SSIS_Setup4](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/b5a41cbe-305f-4fc0-9627-ee0880b98845)
Now I have created a new project and above is the SSIS interface, on the left pane under the SSIS toolbox you will see the favorites menu, click to expand it and drag the Data Flow Task to the canvas
![SSIS_Setup5](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/af058f1d-0101-4300-b398-d01d5033314f)
Next, rename the Data Flow Task to Amazon Sales Data
![SSIS_Setup6](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/51d72393-551d-453d-8d27-a67f4889f220)
click on the control Flow to see the newly created dataflow task.
Now to continue the process click on Data Flow
![SSIS_Setup7](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/01ccf353-f60f-4782-b05f-0a414b26934f)
While in the Data Flow task, on the left pane, expand Other Sources and select and drag the Flat File Source to the canvas
![SSIS_Setup8](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Create-ETL-Process-in-SSIS/assets/161846069/bb4f93de-9ac5-4eb5-96de-9a712c379adf)
On the left pane under destination, select and drag OLE DB Destination into the canvas. So right now inside the canvas, we have the flat file source and the destination, the flat file source will help collect the data from the source and the OLE DB Destination will help set up the data in the database
